# Green Hydrogen: Fueling a Sustainable Future

A sustainable system for producing green hydrogen, mainly powered by solar energy, designed and implemented by Suez Canal University students.

## Project Overview

This website showcases a graduation project from the Mechanical Engineering Department at Suez Canal University (2025/2026). The project focuses on developing an innovative system for green hydrogen production using renewable energy sources.

## Key Features

- **Solar-Powered Desalination**: Efficient water purification using solar still technology enhanced with waste heat
- **Alkaline Electrolysis**: Advanced electrolyzer with innovative nickel-coated stainless-steel electrodes
- **High Efficiency**: System efficiency improved from 79% to 82%
- **Sustainable Production**: Around 300 liters of hydrogen per hour using clean energy

## Technical Specifications

### Water Quality Data
- **Sea Water (before distillation)**: pH 8.3, TDS 42,000 mg/L, Conductivity 55,000 µS/cm
- **Distilled Water (after distillation)**: pH 6.5, TDS 25 mg/L, Conductivity 10 µS/cm

### Efficiency Results
- Normal Distillation Efficiency: Approximately 21.8%
- Distillation with Heater Efficiency: Approximately 55.6%

### Solar System
- 72-cell solar modules with 36 volts
- Clean and renewable energy source for electrolysis
